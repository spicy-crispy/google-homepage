The Odin Project's Google homepage mini-project

First project done! It's a little bit messy, but it resembles Google's home page at the very least.
This mini-project's goal is to build Google's homepage with HTML and CSS only. I decided to utilize Flexbox, which made aligning things a lot easier.

random notes:
- a:link is great and so is !important
- this took me a long time (I soon gave up "pixel perfection" placement)
- i got the hover effects in and that was cool? the shadow effect on the search bar i got by inspecting element though.
- couldn't figure out how to place the small magnifying glass image inside the search bar
- i am still iffy on div nesting for flex containers, but i guess i can figure out a very basic layout.
